# code-server-heroku
Launch automatic cloud dev workspaces ☁️

## Why develop on a Heroku dyno?
- Code from any device, even an iPad or Chromebook
- Create a new workspace for each project, with the exact config they need
- Run unlimited dynos for free, up to 1000 total hours per month. They shut down after 30m of inactivity.

Note: Heroku does not have a persistant filesystem. Make sure you are using a source-control provider, like git.

## Ways to get started:

## Todo: 
- [ ] Create base image
- [ ] Create sample images
- [ ] Create GitHub action to build
- [ ] Impliment code-server-controller app
